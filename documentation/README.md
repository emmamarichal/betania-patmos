## Collaborative. Open Source. Free. Work in progress

Betània Patmos has been released under the SIL Open Font Licence, and is available for free download. It was both a request and a vision of the Betània Patmos school that it be developed in this framework to share achievements and address the questions it raises with other educational spaces. In this way, the results obtained are made available to enrich the project through collaborative work.  

Currently, Betània Patmos Font supports Catalan, Spanish, English, Guaraní, and German. Our goal is to expand the character set so that more languages can use this tool. We also aim to adapt specific morphological letterforms that are most familiar to diferent regions, for example, the letterforms' r, t, and z have particular ductus in German.  

We invite teachers, educators, pedagogues, and anyone interested in developing digital tools for teaching reading and writing to use this font and share their experiences with us.  

If you want to collaborate on the project, you can connect to our GitHub repository or email us.
